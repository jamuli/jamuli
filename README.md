- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jamuli
I have my B.S. in Civil and Environmental Engineering but I have a minor in Computer Science and love to code.
I'm still teaching myself a lot about Web Development, AI, and Machine Learning but am interested in finding new interesting projets that intersect my two disciplines of study
CEE and CS. 

Feel free to send me an email at javimulero2@gmail.com if you'd like to have a chat.
